I used stewart's model, but just tweaked the weights to be .45 .45 .1, because i felt like gender and age is a lot more important than race 
because I feel like a majority of the women are going to be voting for Hillary, and that a majority of the people over a certain age are also
going to be voting for hillary as well.  And vice versa where a majority of the people below a certain age like college students are going to
be voting for bernie.
